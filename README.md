Attention! This README is a copy of the original project at https://github.com/TheRadMatt/3D-FPP-Interaction-Demo, 
the credit for all First Person View code, and interactions with objects goes to them, I just started building on top
of it as it seemed like a good starting point for a 3D first person game. The idea will be to make 100 levels, hence 100 doors :)
If you want to design a level just make sure to use Godot 3.5.2 and opening the project should be easy, if you need any help
just contact me at matheusrotta7@gmail.com.

------- FROM THIS POINT ON THE README IS FROM THE ORIGINAL PROJECT

# GODOT Engine 3D FPP Interaction Demo
[Godot 3.x] First Person Perspective demo/template.

# Features:
* Movement (walking, sprinting, jumping, crouching)
* Using ladders
* Using stairs
* Interaction system
* Picking up (and throwing) objects

Also showcasing:
* Different RigidBody physics
* Animation states for interactable objects

# Instructions:
* Movement: WASD
* Jump: SPACE
* Walk: ALT
* Sprint: CTRL
* Interact: E
* Pick up/leave: F
* Throw: LMB (hold)
* Reset: R

# It needs some more polish:
There are a couple of things that could be fixed. Mainly rigid objects clipping through walls and through the drawers (when you put a ball into a drawer and close it, the ball clipps through). Not sure how it can be fixed though.
